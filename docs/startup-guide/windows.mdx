</div></div>

## Expected environment

In this document, the following environment is assumed.

* OS: Windows 10/11, 64 bit version
* Development environment (One of them)
    * Python 3.11 (with VS Code)
    * C++: Visual Studio 2019/2022
* Hardware:
    * USB3.0 compatible USB port x2

## Prerequisite

* Python 3.11
* Git

## Sensing-dev Software Packages

Please DL the installer script at the top of the page or [here](https://github.com/Sensing-Dev/sensing-dev-installer/releases/download/v23.10.00-beta2/installer.ps1).

If you have admin privileges on windows, you can just right-click the downloaded script and choose "Run with Posweshell".

Otherwise, you can open powershell terminal and type `.\installer.ps1 -user <username>`.

The default installation path would be `"C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\sensing-dev-installer"`.

:::caution why it does not work
When you get 

> installer.ps1 cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled on this system

your powershell does not allow to run the script. If so, please add `-ExecutionPolicy Bypass` option as the following example:

```bash
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\installer.ps1 -user <username>
```
:::

## Set environment variables.

Running the installer.ps1 script would **automatically set** the environment variable `%PATH%` and `%SENSING_DEV_ROOT%` which SDK requires, so you may skip this step.

However, if you change the default path or move the package location, it requires to set them manually with the following precedure:

1. Hit Windows key **&#8862;** or click **&#8862;** at the corner of task bar to use start-menu.

2. Type **Environment variable** to find **Edit environment variables got your account** to open the window of **Environment Variables**.

![Start-menu](./img/start-menu.png)

3. There's environment variables for user and system at the top and bottom of the window respectively, and we edit user variables.

![Start-menu](./img/environment-variables.png)

4. With `New` and `Edit`, set the following environment variables.

| Name of variable | Value | New/Edit(append) |
| --------   | ------- | ------- |
| SENSING_DEV_ROOT | `<where you installed SKD>` | NEW |
| PATH | `<where you installed SKD>/bin` | Edit(append) |
| PYTHONPATH | `<where you installed SKD>/lib/site-package` | Edit(append) |

:::info Confirmation
Using `arv-tool-0.8` may help to check if the software package is appropriately installed. Please check [this page](../external/aravis/arv-tools.md) to know the procedure.
