:::note

For Windows, the driver (WinUSB) comes with Windows OS.

Halide is the language for efficient image processing, and GenDC Separator is a library to treat [GenDC Data format](../lessons/camera.md).

## libUSB/WinUSB

Driver allows Computer OS to communicate with hardware. At the upper part of software stack, we use camera acquisition library called Aravis which controls U3V Cameras over **libUSB** and **WinUSB** on Linux and Windows respectively.

For Linux, the script for the installation includes libUSB.

Oh the otherhand, WinUSB comes with Windows OS, but the program to apply the driver to U3V device is included in the installer.

## Aravis

[**Aravis**&#128279;](https://aravisproject.github.io/aravis/) is a GObject based camera acquisition library that allows to control U3V camera and GigE camera devices. 

This library has APIs to control the camera device which allows to set/get some parameters, start/stop the device, and acquiring the image data from the device.

It also provides some simple tools of accessing GenICam features, obtaining the payload of streaming data, and displaying the captured images.

## ion-kit

[**ion-kit**&#128279;](https://github.com/fixstars/ion-kit) is an image processing framework which enables to efficiently describe and compile a user-defined image processing pipeline. 

General image processing programs mainly have three steps: input (load from a file or acquiting data from device), image-processing, and output (save or display).

However, ion-kit has readymade building blocks (BBs) for those steps, and the whole process of them can be done by the single pipeline consisting of the combination of those BBs. 

The building blocks is written in Halide, a language for efficient image processing, embedded in C++.
