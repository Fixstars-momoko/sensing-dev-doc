</div></div>

## Expected environment

In this document, the following environment is assumed.

* OS: Windows 10/11, 64 bit version
* Development environment (One of them)
    * Python 3.11 (with VS Code)
    * C++: Visual Studio 2019/2022
* Hardware:
    * USB3.0 compatible USB port x2

## Prerequisite

* Python 3.11
* Git

## Sensing-dev Software Packages

Please DL the installer script at the top of the page or [here](https://github.com/Sensing-Dev/sensing-dev-installer/releases/download/v23.11.01/installer.ps1).

You can open powershell terminal and type `.\installer.ps1 -version v23.11.01` to install the SDK. If you have no admin privileges, add `-user <username>`.

The default installation path would be `"C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\sensing-dev"`.

:::caution why it does not work
When you get 

> installer.ps1 cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled on this system

your powershell does not allow to run the script. If so, please add `-ExecutionPolicy Bypass` option as the following example:

```bash
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\installer.ps1 -user <username> -version v23.11.01
```
:::

If you with to use python-binding (ionpy), please install with pip.

```bash
pip3 install -U pip
pip3 install "git+https://github.com/fixstars/ion-kit.git@v0.3.5#egg=ionpy&subdirectory=python" 
```


## Install WinUSB driver on U3V device.

This step is only required the first time a U3V camera device is connected to a host machine.
1. Check your U3V camera device using Device Manager. In the search box on the taskbar, type device manager, then select Device Manager from the menu.

![before_installed](./img/winusb-install-before_installed.png)

The image shows there are two unknown U3V camera devices connected on my host machine and we need to install the WinUSB driver.


2. **Download the script from [HERE](https://github.com/Sensing-Dev/sensing-dev-installer/releases/download/v23.11.01/installer-WinUSB.ps1)** and right-click to run it in PowerShell.
Please note that this process requires administrative privileges on your account and may take up to 5 minutes.

3. If you can see your device name in the following image, it means the WinUSB driver is installed.

![installed](./img/winusb-install-installed.png)


:::tip If you want to uninstall driver

1. Open Device Manager again, and right click on your device and choose uninstall device.

![uninstall](./img/winusb-uninstall-uninstall.png)

2. Click the checkbox and click uninstall device

![clickbox](./img/winusb-uninstall-checkbox.png)

3. Open Action and click scan for hardware changes

![hardware](./img/winusb-uninstall-hardware.png)

If your device is displaying as an unknown device, congratulations! The WinUSB driver has been successfully uninstalled!
:::
## Set environment variables.

Running the installer.ps1 script would **automatically set** the environment variable `%PATH%` and `%SENSING_DEV_ROOT%` which SDK requires, so you may skip this step.

However, if you change the default path or move the package location, it requires to set them manually with the following precedure:

1. Hit Windows key **&#8862;** or click **&#8862;** at the corner of task bar to use start-menu.

2. Type **Environment variable** to find **Edit environment variables got your account** to open the window of **Environment Variables**.

![Start-menu](./img/start-menu.png)

3. There's environment variables for user and system at the top and bottom of the window respectively, and we edit user variables.

![Start-menu](./img/environment-variables.png)

4. With `New` and `Edit`, set the following environment variables.

| Name of variable | Value | New/Edit(append) |
| --------   | ------- | ------- |
| SENSING_DEV_ROOT | `<where you installed SKD>` | NEW |
| PATH | `<where you installed SKD>/bin` | Edit(append) |
| PYTHONPATH | `<where you installed SKD>/lib/site-package` | Edit(append) |

:::info Confirmation
Using `arv-tool-0.8` may help to check if the software package is appropriately installed. Please check [this page](../external/aravis/arv-tools.md) to know the procedure.
