## What is Sensing-Dev?

**Sensing-Dev** is the project to support [**USB3 Vision (U3V) Camera**](https://www.automate.org/a3-content/usb3-vision-standard) users by providing the software package, tutorials, and the discussion forums.

While U3V camera based on **GenICam standard** allows you to easily control camera devices, 
you may be unsure where to start your project. 
This webpage whould help to get **access** your U3V camera and obtain **sensor data** from the device.

The software package consists of all **Open Source Software** and libraries, 
so you can develop your image processing application on your research and commercial use.

## Goal

Our goal is to support U3V camera users to easily develop their machine vision project with generic and platform-independent image-processing framework based on the following software stack.
