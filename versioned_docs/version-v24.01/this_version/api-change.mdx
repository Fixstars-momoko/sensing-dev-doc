# API Update: What's New & Tips

This page is for the users updating Sensing-Dev SDK from v23.11.01 to v24.01.04.

The update including ion-kit major release and there's some API changes. 

Note that the old API is still supported on v24.01.04.

## API changes

### Removed `dispose` input port

In Sensing-Dev v23.11.01 (ion-kit 0.3.5), BB using USB 3 Vision Camera requires `dispose` input to explicitly set when to close the device. 

In Sensing-Dev v24.01.04 (ion-kit 1.6.0), BB using USB 3 Vision Camera does not retuire this input anymore, and stop camera when the instance of your `builder` is released.

If you want to see exactly when the instance and camer is released, you can set environment variable `ION_LOG_LEVEL` to `debug`. See the detail in [Debug Tips](../lessons/ion-log).

### Optional `gain`/`exposuretime` input port

In Sensing-Dev v23.11.01 (ion-kit 0.3.5), BB using USB 3 Vision Camera requires `gain` and `exposuretime` inputs to set the camera's Gain and ExposureTime.

In Sensing-Dev v24.01.04 (ion-kit 1.6.0), these inputs are optional, and you can use input Param `enable_control` to set `gain` and `exposuretime` inputs; otherwise, you don't have to set them explicitly.

### Remove `PortMap`

In Sensing-Dev v23.11.01 (ion-kit 0.3.5), we needed object of `PortMap` to set input value to each input/output `Port`.

In Sensing-Dev v24.01.04 (ion-kit 1.6.0), we can directly set input value with `bind()` which is a member function of `Port`.

### Rename API to set input port to BB

In Sensing-Dev v23.11.01 (ion-kit 0.3.5), the name of function to set input port to BB is `set_port`.

In Sensing-Dev v24.01.04 (ion-kit 1.6.0), the name of function to set input port to BB is `set_iport`.
