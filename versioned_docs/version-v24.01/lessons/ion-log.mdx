# Debug Tips

This is the page for users seeking to debug their applications effectively.
Understanding the intricacies of debugging requires insight into the multiple levels of our Software Development Kit (SDK).
Delving deeper into this topic, you can find detailed information about these levels by checking [Sogtware Package](../startup-guide/software-stack), 
and we offer debug tools for the Aravis (Camera Acquisition Library) and ion-kti (Image Processing Framework), empowering you to pinpoint issues with precision and efficiency.

## Aravis

For Aravis, you can set environment varialbe `ARV_DEBUG` to set the log-level to see the internal process of this library.

If you think an issue is on device, transport, or stream, you may want to set this to check each category.

See the detail in [the official website](https://aravisproject.github.io/docs/aravis-0.4/aravis-building.html).

### ion-kit

For ion-kit, you can set environment varialbe `ION_LOG_LEVEL` to set the log-level to see the internal process of this library.

If you think an issue is on your framework or controling device through ion-kit, you may want to set this to debug.

#### Example with Balser with tutorial 1

Following is the console output of [Tutorial 1](../tutorials/python/display-image) after setting the environment variable `ION_LOG_LEVEL=debug`

This simple tutorial code just obtain image in BB and use OpenCV to display the image, and you can see 

* The version of ion-kit
* The ID of U3V class instance
* Camera information to use
* When exactly the device  `AcquisitionStart`/`AcquisitionStop` is executed
* When exactly the device is closed (`U3V::release_instance() :: is finished`)

```bash
$ python python/tutorial1_display.py

If your application is not working, you can display these log and check where the issue occurs.
